        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Classes can be used multiple times compared to ids only being able to be used once</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When you create a stylesheet you need to link it in the html using &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./location/name.css"&gt </li>
          <li>Don't forget to reset defaults by having *{ margin:0; padding:0;} as the first line on your stylesheet.
          <li>To inline style stuff with css place it in the &lt;head&gt; and use &lt;element style="property:value"&gt; or &lt;style&gt; then type like you normally would on a stylesheet and don't forget the closing tag.
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element an</li>
          <li> <strong>SPECIFICITY</strong><br> ID > CLASSES > ELEMENT <br>
            This is the priority of targeting. !important will overrule other selectors even ones more specific.
          <li> <strong>Targeting</strong><br>
            To target an element just type the name of the element<br>
            To target a class .class-name<br>
            To target an id #id-name<br>
            To target everything use an asterik(*)<br>
            To target specific things chain the class and element by typing both with no comma seperating them<br>
            To target multiple elements, classes, or ids, use commas to seperate each one you target<br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Margin Collapse</strong><br>
            When creating margin with two images or boxes horizontally next to each other they combine the margin to decide the distance from each other.<br>
            When creating margin with two images or boxes vertically next to each other they use the largest margin to decide the distance from each other.
          </li>
          <li><em><strong>Psuedo-Class</em></strong><br>You can use :focus, :visited, :disabled, or :hover following the selector to determine when the CSS initiates. (e.g) h1:hover
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull location location: this pulls data from one location to another to update or check for bugs with the code.
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>use &lt;script src="./location/name.js&gt; after the footer in the &lt;body&gt;</li>
          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom and order counts.</li>
          <li> if statements work as so: if (condition){ <br>     // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy <br> }
          <li> if else statements work as so: if (first condition) {<br>      // block of code to be executed if first condition is truthy<br>} else if (second condition) {<br>      // block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy<br>} and so on<br><strong>Example Given</strong>:  if (0) {<br>      console.log("I'm 0!")<br>} else if (null) {<br>     console.log("I'm null!")<br>} else if (true) {<br>      console.log("I'm true!")<br>} </li>
          <li> === is a strict equality operator and checks to see if the two values are equal, and returns a boolean result (true or false) </li>
          <li> To create a single variable use: var name = value;
          <li> Arrays hold multiple pieces of data and are used as so: var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true]; only 'Lu' has to be in quotation marks because its a string, 54 is a number and true is a boolean so they don't require quotation marks. Arrays are also zero-indexed and sequential meaning the first piece of data is also '0' and the next piece of data '1' and so forth. If you want to access the data in the array you start with the name of the variable that stores the array then add brackets and the index of the data you want. (i.e) console.log[studentInfo[1]; this will display the student's age in the console. </li>
          <li> a for loop works as so: for(var x = 0; x &lt; array-name.length; x++) { <br> console.log(array-name[x]);<br>} // This allows the system to automatically change the output for as many as there are by creating a variable 'x' and making the loop go as a long as 'x' is less than the array length. Then inside of the for loop you put whatever code youre wanting it to repeat. Always make your variable start at 0 because arrays start at 0 and then 'variable-name++' at the end to increase its value.
          <li> /* */ is how you create comments or comment out code.
